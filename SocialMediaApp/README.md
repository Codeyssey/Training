## Git Guidelines

- Always work in a branch
- Always push to your branch
- Branch name should be prefixed with user name (e.g. tauseef-todo)
- Regularly commit your changes (atleast one commit a day)
- Never try to commit in main/master/develop/prod branch even if they are not protected
- Commit message should be descriptive like:
    ```sh
    git commit -m “Fix made for todo tasks issues” -m “WHAT: describe what it is” -m “WHY: context of the change” -m “IMPACT: HIGH”
    ```
