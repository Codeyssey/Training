Exercise:
Build a simple Application which

stores ToDo tasks with a due date for each user.

The App should expose following endpoints for CRUD and auth operations.
You can use either MySQL or MongoDb (recommended) as the database.

<!-- TODO Register a new user -->

user -> name, email, password

<!-- ? signup form ->
email ->
    check if email is valid,
    check if email already exist
    optional -> send verify email on the acc email
password ->0
    standard pw verifications

<!-- TODO User login -->

<!-- TODO Add a Task -->

<!-- TODO Edit a Task -->

<!-- TODO Delete a Task -->

<!-- TODO Get All Tasks for a user -->

<!-- TODO Assign an Internal / External user a task by email address. If the user doesnâ€™t exist send them an email to sign up. Once they signup that note should be assigned to them automatically. -->

<!-- TODO Add Request Logging for APIs -->

<!-- TODO API Request Validations -->

Share the postman collection to test the endpoints
